# Library_Management_system_project
# ðŸ“š Library Management System â€“ C++

This is a simple, console-based Library Management System built using **Core C++** and **Object-Oriented Programming** concepts.
## ðŸ”§ Features
- **Add new books** with title, author, and ID
- **View all books** stored in the library
- **Issue or return books** with ID tracking
- **Persistent storage** using file handling (`.txt` file)
- Uses **classes, vectors, constructors**, and **string**

## ðŸ’¡ Key Concepts Used
- Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Objects, Encapsulation)
- File Handling (`ifstream`, `ofstream`)
- Dynamic storage using Vectors
- `static` methods for parsing strings to objects

## ðŸ—‚ Files
- `main.cpp`: Contains the complete project logic and menu system
- `LIBRARY.TXT`: Stores book data persistently

## ðŸ§  Learning Outcome
This project helped me strengthen my understanding of:
- C++ OOP principles
- Safe and effective file I/O operations
- Applying real-world logic to object-oriented design

## ðŸš€ Future Enhancements
- Add user login system (admin/member)
- Search or sort books by title or author
- GUI using C++/Qt or integrate with web interface
